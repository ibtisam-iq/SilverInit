# This script automates the setup of a jumpbox server for managing AWS resources.

# and set up AWS CLI, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes tools.
# It runs on a fresh Ubuntu server instance.

# The following scripts are executed in sequence:
# 1. sys-info-and-update.sh
# 2. aws-cli-conf.sh
# 3. terraform-setup.sh
# 4. ansible-setup.sh
# 5. kubectl-and-eksctl.sh
# 6. Helm installation
