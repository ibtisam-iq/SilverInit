# SilverInit - Jumpbox Setup
# -------------------------------------------------
# This script automates the setup of a jumpbox server for managing AWS resources.
# It executes a sequence of scripts to configure the OS, install required tools,
# and set up AWS CLI, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes tools.
# It runs on a fresh Ubuntu server instance.

# The following scripts are executed in sequence:
# 1. preflight.sh
# 2. sys-info-and-update.sh
# 3. aws-cli-conf.sh
# 4. terraform-setup.sh
# 5. ansible-setup.sh
# 6. kubectl-and-eksctl.sh
# 7. helm-setup.sh

set -e  # Exit immediately if a command fails
set -o pipefail  # Ensure failures in piped commands are detected

# Function to handle script failures
